#### <span style="color: #4682b4;"> About Me</span>

I am a first-year ScM student in biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (BSPH). I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a Bachelor of Science in Molecular & Cellular Biology and a minor in Applied Math and Statistics. I have some previous research experience using R, but I am new to github and hope to learn more. Broadly speaking, I am interested in multi-omics approaches to tackle chronic and complex illnesses, such as identifying biomarkers or characterizing individual variability to better prevent and diagnose chronic diseases. At BSPH, I hope to gain more experience in clinical trial and precision medicine.
