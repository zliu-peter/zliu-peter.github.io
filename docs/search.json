Prolific game designers by the number of games designed since the 1990.\n\n\n\n\nClearly, we see that Reiner Knizia absolutely dominated in quantity of games developed, with his peak active years in the 2000s and 2010s. Some other creative game designers who designed many games are (1) Wolfgang Kramer, who were mostly active in the 1990s and 2000s; (2) Martin Wallace, Matt Hyra, Eric M. Lang who became more prolific in the 2010s; and (3) Prospero Hall who emerged in the 2020s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe lower number of games developed in the 2020s are partially due to a lack of data collected in recent years.\n\n\nNext, I take a closer look at both the amount of games and rating stratified by each decade. The rating are depicted by the color gradient while the bars represent the number of games developed.\nWe see some aforementioned familiar names appear, meaning that those who were one of the most prolific designers were typically quite active for over 30 years. For instance, Reiner Knizia topped the charts in three decades since the 1990s. Based on the color gradient, his rating seemed to suffer a bit in the 2000s but recovered in 2010s. Overall, these designers are usually both prolific and critically acclaimed by users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe game rating was averaged for all the games developed by that designer in the corresponding decades.\n\n\n\n\nShow Code\n# While Reiner dominated when looking at each decade separately (average rating for each dacade instead of for all the decades combined). The sheer amount of games he produced might have lower his mean rating, but it is still a quite impressive rating.\n\nggplot(games_designer, aes(x=tidytext::reorder_within(designer, count, decades), y=count, fill=score)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  tidytext::scale_x_reordered()+\n  scale_fill_gradient(low=\"#96E9FF\", high=\"#0354AF\")+\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title=\"Top 5 Most Prolific Game Designer in Each Decade\",\n       x=\"Board Game Designer\",\n       y=\"# of Games Designed in This Decade\",\n       subtitle=\"1.

Top 5 prolific game designers in each decade.\n\n\n\n\nHow are their games’ ratings?\nWe have a glimpse at the ratings from Fig 3 through the filled color. To directly observe the user ratings of games, we plot the rating distribution of top 10 most prolific game designers spanning over 30 years. Here, “top 10 most prolific” is defined as having the top 10 highest number of games developed during 1990 to 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIt is not necessarily the best to identify brilliant game designers solely through their user ratings, since they are heavily dependent on the number of ratings/games available.\n\n\n\n\nShow Code\ntop10_rated_designers &lt;- games %&gt;%\n  separate_rows(designer, sep = \";\\\\s*\") %&gt;%\n  dplyr::group_by(designer) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::summarise(`Avg Rating`=mean(average), `# Game`=n()) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::ungroup() %&gt;%\n  dplyr::mutate(designer=gsub(\"'\",\"\",designer)) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(designer)) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::filter(designer!=\"'(Uncredited)'\") %&gt;%\n  dplyr::arrange(desc(`Avg Rating`)) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::slice_head(n=5) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::rename(Designer=designer)\n\nkable(top10_rated_designers, format=\"html\",\n      caption=\"Highest Rated Designers\") %&gt;%\n  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE) %&gt;%\n  column_spec(3, bold=TRUE, color=\"red\") %&gt;%\n  kable_classic_2(html_font=\"Garamond\")\n\n\n\n\nHighest Rated Designers\n\n\nDesigner\nAvg Rating\n# Game\n\n\n\n\nGener Escalante Hernandez\n9.43\n1\n\n\nFlorian Dumont\n9.36\n1\n\n\nGabriele Porro\n9.09\n1\n\n\nCarly Shields\n9.04\n1\n\n\nMichael DiMauro\n9.04\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we see, the top 5 highest rated designers only developed less than 5 games.

Top 15 most owned games (1990-2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThese designers, while might not be as prolific, are also considered one of the best, as they created some of the most successful board games.\n\n\nAssociation between owned status and game rating?\nWe see that these top-selling games are also highly rated, so I wonder, is there any correlation between # of people owning the games and their rating?\n\n\nShow Code\nggplot(data=owned_games %&gt;% filter(owned&gt;=100), aes(x=owned, y=average)) +\n  geom_hex(bins=45) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option=\"D\") +\n  geom_smooth(stat=\"smooth\", color=\"red\") +\n  scale_x_log10() +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Number of People Owning the Game\",\n       y = \"Rating of the Game\",\n       title = \"Game Rating vs. Number of People Owning the Game\",\n       subtitle = \"A potential positive association is found, though many games cluster around \\nrating = 6-7 and # owned = between 100~1000.\",\n       caption = \"Only games owned by at least 100 people are included in the analysis.\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=21, face=\"bold\"),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size=16),\n        plot.caption = element_text(size=12, face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size=18, face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size=18, face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(size=15))\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 7. Association of rating vs. owned status.\n\n\n\n\nWe see a slight positive trend, though more investigation is needed to elucidate the exact relationship.\nWhat game categories are popular in each year?\nNext, I assess popular game categories in each year.\n\n\nShow Code\ngames_category &lt;- games %&gt;%\n  separate_rows(category, sep = \";\\\\s*\") %&gt;%\n  dplyr::group_by(yearpublished, category) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::summarise(count=n()) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::arrange(yearpublished, desc(count)) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::slice_head(n=3) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::mutate(category=gsub(\"^'(.+)'$|^\\\"(.+)\\\"$\", \"\\\\1\\\\2\", category))\n\n\nHere, we see that card games are extremely popular ever since the 90s. Dice and fantasy games are also growing in popularity in recent years.\n\n\nShow Code\npal = c(\"#2F4F4F\",\"#CE5FA7\",\"#DBD4D4\",\"#DE1818\",\"#023DCF\", \n            \"#D580FF\", \"#FFD900\",\"#6B00C2\",\"#00407F\",\n            \"#66E0FF\",\"#B03B56\",\"#90EE90\",\"#A4918C\",\n            \"#3BA500\",\"#000000\")\n\nggplot(games_category , aes(x=yearpublished, y=count, fill=category)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\n  labs(title=\"Top 3 Game Categories by Year\", \n       x=\"Years\",\n       y=\"Frequency\",\n       subtitle=\"Card game is by far the most popular game category over the years.\",\n       caption=\"Some games are associated with multiple categories.\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=pal) +\n  theme(legend.text = element_text(size=10),\n        legend.title = element_text(size=14),\n        plot.title = element_text(size=19, face=\"bold\"),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12),\n        plot.caption = element_text(size=9, face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(size=14, face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(size=10)) +\n   guides(fill=guide_legend(title=\"Category\",keyheight=1, keywidth=1,ncol=1))\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 8. Trends of top 3 game categories over time (1990-2023).\n\n\n\n\nWe can also see some interesting trends here that the 90s popular game categories are more associated with wars, potentially a result of the cold war that ended in 1991.\nWhat game mechanics are popular in each year?\nSimilarly, we look at popular game mechanics. That is, the mode of the board game or how it is played.\n\n\nShow Code\ngames_mechanic &lt;- games %&gt;%\n  separate_rows(mechanic, sep = \";\\\\s*\") %&gt;%\n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(mechanic)) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::group_by(yearpublished, mechanic) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::summarise(count=n()) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::arrange(yearpublished, desc(count)) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::slice_head(n=3) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::mutate(mechanic=gsub(\"^'(.+)'$|^\\\"(.+)\\\"$\", \"\\\\1\\\\2\", mechanic))\n\n\n\n\nShow Code\npal = c(\"#2F4F4F\",\"#CE5FA7\",\"#023DCF\",\"#A4918C\",\"#ADD8E6\", \n            \"#FFA07A\", \"#FFD700\",\"#6B00C2\",\"#DDA0DD\",\n            \"#66E0FF\",\"#B03B56\",\"#DE1818\",\"#3BA500\",\n            \"#EEE8AA\",\"#000000\")\n\nggplot(games_mechanic , aes(x=yearpublished, y=count, fill=mechanic)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\n  labs(title=\"Top 3 Game Mechanics by Year\", \n       x=\"Years\",\n       y=\"Frequency\",\n       subtitle=\"Dice rolling, hand management, and variable player power games are popular game mechanics.\",\n       caption=\"Some games are associated with multiple mechanics.\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=pal) +\n  theme(legend.text = element_text(size=10),\n        legend.title = element_text(size=14),\n        plot.title = element_text(size=19, face=\"bold\"),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12),\n        plot.caption = element_text(size=9, face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(size=14, face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(size=10)) +\n   guides(fill=guide_legend(title=\"mechanic\",keyheight=1, keywidth=1,ncol=1))\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 9. Trends of top 3 game mechanics over time (1990-2023).\n\n\n\n\nWe observed that dice rolling, hand management, and variable player power games are very popular."
